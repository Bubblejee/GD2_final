On May 31, 2018, the day of the lunar eclipse, there was a great occasion in the Gemini. It was the birth of a fraternal twin that resembled the Geminiâ€™s king and queen. The king of Gemini called the name Pam for a girl and Pom for a boy. The birth of the Gemini Princess and the Prince brought happiness to all the Gemini people. The twins were half-god and half-mage as a god of father and a mage of mother. They have been very different from others since they were born. The twins were fluent in the language of all the world. Born in the nature of fire, they had a superpower of pyromania, disintegrate, incinerate and molten. But they also had weaknesses that were ice which is cold and thunderstorm which is loud. For these twins, the Gemini people gave many gifts, the Gemini's best mage gave Pam a fire flower and Pom a fire hammer. Pam and Pom quickly learned the function of the weapon. They will have a mission to defeat the enemies that is now on another planet .... 
Can Pam and Pom help each other to save the Gemini?</div>
